# Coursera Capston Full Report:

## >> Introduction - business problem.

Assume you are a global investor in field of gastronomy and you are looking to open a chain of restaurants in biggest cities in Europe. Many cities...

Obviously you don not know every single city, and actually don't know where to locate your restaurants. Whether it's good idea to invest only in city centers, or maybe most of restaurants are hidden in some specific districts.

The aim of this analysis if to automatically find area of city with biggest density of restaurants and nightlife facilities using segmentation. I'll be profiling districts of Warsaw (capital city of Poland) as a small prof of concept because I know the city and can verify whether findings from segmentation looks reasonable or not.


## >> Data used to solve the problem and the source of the data.

* Scraped list of postal codes in Warsaw: http://www.kody-pocztowe.dokladnie.com/ There are more than 4k of them, so I used sample of them.

* After we get postal codes we can geocode them and get latitudes and longitutes for map visualisation.

* Finally Foursquare location data - via Foursqare API we can obtain POI with categories, like restaurants, shops, parks etc..
